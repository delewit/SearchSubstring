Scala is a great programming language.
Haskell is another great programming language.
Java is also a wonderful programming language.
OCaml is yet another very powerful programming language.
I also think that the Racket programming language is really amazing!
And of course we all love the simple yet extremely versatile Python programming language.
Apple enthusiasts who also like to program are mostly interested in Swift.
Web developers who rely mostly on the Rails framework, prefer to program in Ruby.
Power users of Unix and Linux terminals rely heavily on Bash and Zsh, don't they?
Most old school computer programmers still prefer to program in C and C++.
C, C++, and Java are examples of object-oriented programming languages.
Scala, Haskell, and OCaml are examples of functional programming languages.
Scala however, is not purely functional.
Scala is a functional first language, but also offers support for object-oriented programming.
Of course all computer programming languages ultimately owe a great deal to the discipline of mathematics.
However, my favorite computer language of all is without question, SCALA!!!
